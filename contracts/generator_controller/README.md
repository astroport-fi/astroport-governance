# Generator Controller

The Generator Controller allows vxASTRO holders to vote on changing `alloc_point`s in the Generator contract every 2 weeks. Note that the Controller contract uses the word "pool" when referring to LP tokens (generators) available in the Generator contract. Its interface can be found [here](../../packages/generator_controller/README.md)
