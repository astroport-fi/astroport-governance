# Vote Escrowed Staked ASTRO

The vxASTRO contract allows xASTRO token holders to stake their tokens in order to boost their governance power as well as the amount of ASTRO they can get from Generator emissions. Voting power is boosted according to how long someone locks their xASTRO for.

Maximum lock time is 2 years, which gives the maximum possible boost of 2.5. For example, if a token holder locks 100 xASTRO for 2 years, they
get 250 vxASTRO. Their vxASTRO balance then goes down every week for the next 2 years (unless they relock) until it reaches zero.

Its interface can be found [here](../../packages/voting_escrow/README.md)
