# Cw721 Basic

This is a basic implementation of a cw721 NFT contract. It implements
the [CW721 spec](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/main/contracts/cw721-base/README.md) and is designed to
be deployed as is, or imported into other contracts to easily build
cw721-compatible NFTs with custom logic.
